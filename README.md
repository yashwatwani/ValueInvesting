Equal Weight

Equal weights fo each stocks


Quantitative Momentum Strategy


"Momentum investing" means investing in the stocks that have increased in price the most.

For this project, we're going to build an investing strategy that selects the 50 stocks with the highest price momentum. From there, we will calculate recommended trades for an equal-weight portfolio of these 50 stocks.


Quantitative Value
